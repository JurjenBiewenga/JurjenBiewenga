Both players have their own tower made of many glasses but some are not like the others. A couple of glasses clearly belong to the opponent and you can't live with that. By using your well trained voice, you pinpoint the exact frequency at which those glasses will break. With each broken glass the tower gets ever so slightly less stable. Before you know it, the whole tower comes crashing down and only a few glasses remain on your table.",
